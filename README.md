# Introduction

Video games has always been a part of my life and I was looking away to incorporate it in to my studies. What better way than to analyse data about videogames and the people that play them.  

This Project uses the Steam API to download and analyze player and game data. It uses R to:  
- Fetch player summaries and game libraries using the Steam API.  
- Create an `S4` object `steam_player` to organize player and library data.  
- Generate visualizations for:  
    - The top 10 most played games.  
    - Average playtime for top games.  

## Libraries used in this Project

These are the libraries needed for analysis of the data. These below are samples and are subject to change with the final iteration of the project.

###

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2). 
library(httr). 
library(jsonlite). 
```

##  Function Explanation

Here I will talk about the uses and what the functions do. 

-- steamIDGenerate(api_key, n)     
-- Function 2    
-- Function 3    

Some details of the data


## Visuals 

In this section I will use functions to show visuals of the calculated data. 

## Inline R code

Here is a test of using in line r code using 2 * 233 =  
```{r eval=TRUE} 
2 * 233 = 
```
